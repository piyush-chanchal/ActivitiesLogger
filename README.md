# Machine-Learning-Enabled-Activities-Logger
This is a Desktop application, we can enter the time spend in a particular activity and select the category. This application stores all the data daywise and once there is encough data collected, this app trains the machine learning model used in this app. After training this application can suggest the categories which user can select while entering hours/minutes, activity done date and other details. 

Basically this application predicts the category which user is going to select while logging the activities. I have used Random forest method of Decision tree machine learning model. The algorithm which I have used by using machine learing in this application can accurately predict the category which user can select. User only need to select the category which will appear at right side in application window and automatically that category will be pushed to category drop down list, so it can save a little bit time of user while logging any activity.
